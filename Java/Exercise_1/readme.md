### Exercise 3:
-Create 10 random characters (A-Za-z) from ascii(65-90)(26+)
-Fill in character array.
-Define a sort method that accept two arguments. 
First argument is the character array that need to be sorted. 
The second argument is a character to denote whether the sorting is in ascending ‘>’ or descending ‘<’ mode. 
The sorting mechanism used is Bubble Sort.
Return the sorted array.
-Print the sorted array.
-Define a find method that accept two arguments.
First argument is the UNSORTED character array.
Second argument is the character that need to be search.
The method should return the index-position of the character in the SORTED array.
-Print the position of the character in the main method.


### Exercise 4
-Define 2 integer arrays with the size of 10 for name "even" and "odd".
-Define an "myEven" method that accept 1 array argument. 
This method fill the array with even numbers with maximmum (100).
Return the array.
-Define an "myOdd" method that accept 1 array argument. 
This method fill the array with odd numbers with maximmum (100).
Return the array.
-Define a method that accept 2 arrays(odd and even)
This method should combine the array into an array with 2-dimension! (Even-ODD)
Return the 2-dimensional array.
-Print the 2D array in the main method.
